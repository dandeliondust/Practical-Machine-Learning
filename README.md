Project Introduction

Devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike Fuelband, and Fitbit are getting increasingly popular due to its ability to track personal activities at a relatively inexpensive price. Users generally use such devices to quantify how much of a particular acitvity they do, but they rarely quantity how well they do it. As such, the goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

For the purpose of this project, we will be using data from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. The data source consists of data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants. The participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
